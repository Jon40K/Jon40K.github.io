        <h2 id="HTMLInfo">The Evolution of HTML 2.0 to HTML 5.0</h2>
        <p>Since the begininng of the Web there has been a main version of HTML</p>
        <h3>Versions of HTML</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML 2.0</li>
            <li>HTML 3.2</li>
            <li>HTML 4.01</li>
            <li>HTML 5.0</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML 2.0</h3>
        <p>HTML 2.0 was released in 1995 and it was designed as a stardard that future versions would be based upon. It was the first version to use the HTML and body tags in the layout. It was also the first version to implement features like users submiting data and triggering an action.</p>
        <h3>HTML 3.2</h3>
        <p>
            HTML 3 was released in 1997.
            It was the first HTML version exclusively developled by the W3C.
            It was code named Wilbur.
            HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas and adopted Netscapes visual markup tags.
            A version for Math forula mark up was made 14 months later called MathML.
        </p>
        <h3>HTML 4.01</h3>
        <p>
            HTML 4 was developed under the code name "Cougar".
            When is was released it came with 3 different variations titled Strict, Transitional and Frameset.
            It was also aiming to phase out the use of Netscapes visual mark up features.
            On the 24th of April 1998 HTML 4.0 was updated to address some bugs present without updating the version number.
            The final major version update came in May 2000 which would be the last version of HTML to be made for many years as the team was occupied with the development of XHTML.
            In strict all deprecated elements are forbidden from being used.
            The strict version was intended for new documents and is considered best practice.
            In transitional deprecated elements are allowed.
            Transitional was made to make it easier to transition documents that conformed to old HTML versions.
            It allowed for the inclusion of these part unlike the Strict version. Looser content model, Presenation related atrributes, Presentation related elements, Frame related entities and Others.
            In frameset mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
            Frameset was made to make it easier to transition documents that did not conform to older versions of HTML.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML 5.0</h3>
        <p>
            HTML 5 is the latest and last major version of HTML as the W3C has retired it and is now being maintained by WHATWG.
            It is now know as the HTML living standard.
            It was first released in 2008.
            It is the current version of HTML.
            One of the main goals was to make it easily readable to humans while being understood by computers.
            There were new elements added like video, audio and canvas.
            It was also designed so old browsers can ignore new structures in HTML 5.
            The HTML 5 logo was published on the 18th of January 2011.

        <h2 id="CSSInfo">Evolution of CSS from CSS1 to CSS3</h2>
        <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets and allows one to style their website to make it look however they want.</p>
        <h3>Versions of CSS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS 1</li>
            <li>CSS 2.0</li>
            <li>CSS 2.1</li>
            <li>CSS 3</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>CSS 1</h3>
        <p>
            CSS 1 was released in 1996.
            It was developed by Hakon Wium Lie and Bert Bos.
            It supported font properties, elements colour attributes, text atributes, allignment, margins/borders and element identification like Id and Class.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            It was published in 1998.
            it came with a bunch of new features, like the ability to move an elements postition, new font properties and media types.
        </p>
        <img id="CSSLogo" src="./Images/CSS_logo.png" alt="CSS Logo"/>
        <h3>CSS 2.1</h3>
        <p>
            CSS 2.1 fixed errors found in CSS 2.
            It removed poorly implemented features.
            After many years of being a draft version, the W3C published CSS2.1 as a official recomendation version in June 2011.
            It was origionally planned to be the only refined edition of CSS 2 but a CSS 2.2 did begin development.
        </p>

        <h3>CSS 3</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike the versions before it, CSS 3 was broken up into modules so different aspects of CSS 3 could be updated when neccessary.
            All the modules added new features or improved upon the CSS2 features.
            It was desigened to preserve backwards compatibility.
            The earlist drafts for CSS 3 began in June 1999.
            While there is not technicaly a CSS 4 and never will be, because of the moduleler system implemented in CSS 3, some of the modules have been upgraded to level 4.
